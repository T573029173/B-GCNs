A Bayesian and graph convolutional networks for the 3D delineation of soil pollution areas at contaminated sites with sparse boreholes


The delineation of pollution areas of concerned pollutants is critical to pollution control, determining the success or failure of remediation projects. However, the accuracy of delineating the soil pollution areas at a contaminated site is influenced by the vertical variation of soil pollutant content, the sparsity and bias of the soil borehole samples, and the 3D delineation model. In order to improve the 3D delineation accuracy of contaminated sites, this study proposed a model coupling naïve Bayesian and graph convolution networks (B-GCNs) to correct the bias of soil samples and capture the 3D spatial structure of the sparse borehole data. 

This work provides a new solution for delineating the soil pollution areas at contaminated sites and further confirms that the GCNs has excellent application potential for the 3D delineation of soil pollution at a contaminated site. The GCNs is one of the more recent deep learning approaches. It can solve complex relationship problems, capture the graph structure of datasets, and is very easy to train even with sparse datasets. So we believe our article will arouse widespread interest from Geoderma’ readers in machine learning, 3D soil mapping, and soil remediation.
